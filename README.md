#autonomous self driving car with lane detection.

developing an autonomous driving system capable of navigating urban environments using sensor data and machine learning algorithms. The system aims to ensure safe and efficient vehicle control with real-time decision-making capabilities.

## I used Nvidia graphis card to generate the data set, adn used a camera at 3 different angle for gathering the data.
